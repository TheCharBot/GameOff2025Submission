the wave of time(brown), 
the wave of evasion(red), and 
the wave of defense(blue)

each wave has own attack

light: almost undodgable, low damage
strength: dodgable, but high damage
speed: undodgable, medium damage
time: buffs other waves with time powers, so save slotting, similar to with the flowey fight
evasion: allows boss and enemies to dodge your attacks
defense: blocks your attacks when active, decently easy to dodge
